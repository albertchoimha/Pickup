# Pickup

Pickup is the name of a personal project I'm working on. Pickup is an application that serves to be a place where individuals with a passion for playing basketball can meet each other and find people to play basketball with. This all started with my desire to work on something that fused my passion for coding and basketball and I've had a lot of fun building this project. Some components I incorporated into this project:

1. 3rd Party API Integration
2. Web Scraping
3. CRUD
4. File Upload (AWS S3)
5. Authentication
